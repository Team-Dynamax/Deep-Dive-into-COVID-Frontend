<p>Trinidad and Tobago recently saw an upsurge of COVID cases after a dormant period. The challenge in
this project is to use publicly available data to measure, compare, visualize and predict significant trends
in this data. It would be useful to compare with other global and regional countries and find trends that
may be useful to inform gov't policies. The use of PowerBI, Tableau or any other visualization
environment is a requirement. The goal of this project is therefore to find, using programmatically
methods, trends and/patterns in publicly available COVID-related data. Analytical methods include (but
are not limited to): data transformation and cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine
learning predictive approaches.

Branch Etiquette<br>
- Create Branch for branch Frontend and Backend for testable code Only <br>
- Other branches can be created for developmental use where you feel appropriate.<br>
- Master branch is restricted.<br>
- To add code to Master Branch the code must be Approved and Verified.<br>

Software Naming Convention:<br>
- The name must be in CamelCase. <br>
- Each module must have a description, updated version and people working on that module at the top of document in comments.<br>
- Each module must contain a function called Version that returns the version number. <br> 
- The version number is in the form 0.0.0. <br>
- The rightmost digit is incremented before every commit on a branch that is not the master, ftontend or backend branch.<br>
- The center digit is incremented before commits made to the frontend and backend branch. <br>
- The leftmost digit is incremented before commits made to the master branch. <br>
- When a digit is incremented, it reset all bits to the right to 0. <br>

Document Naming Convention: <br>
- The name must be in CamelCase followed by ther version number. <br>
- The version number is in the form 0.0. <br>
- The right digit is incremented when changes are made to the document.<br>
- The left digit is incremented when the document is approved by the mentors. <br>
- When a digit is incremented, it reset all bits to the right to 0. <br>
- When changes are made to a document, it must be recorded in the change log at the beginning of that document. <br>
